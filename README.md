Exploratory Data Analysis of H1N1 flu vaccine dataset using R
📌 Project Overview

This project explores patterns and factors associated with H1N1 flu vaccine uptake using exploratory data analysis (EDA). The goal is to understand demographic and health-related variables that may influence vaccination behavior.

🔍 Key Insights (Preliminary)

Age distribution shows variation in vaccine uptake across different age groups.

Sex differences are observed in H1N1 vaccination rates.

Individuals with chronic medical conditions appear more likely to receive the H1N1 vaccine.

Household characteristics, such as the number of children, provide additional context for vaccination decisions.

(Insights will be refined as analysis progresses.)
